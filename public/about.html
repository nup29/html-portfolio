<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web Developer, recently I graduated in Computer Programming from Sheridan College. Since 2016, I have found my 
  interest in Web Development/ Designing. Back in India, I have persued Diploma in Computer Engineering, wherein I learnt the concepts
  of Web Development i.e HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I gained knowlegde about Front-End and Back-End through the course. I also got to learn other programming 
  languages such as C, C++, and Java. During my time in college, I also got the opportunity to develop a complete Website/ Project with
  my fellow teammates. It enhanced not only my Development/ Designing side but also Teamwork and Collaboration skill in depth.</p>

<p>Coming to Sheridan college in Canada, has made me learn a lot about my course and the field. I had the chance to 
    work on different softwares like Visual Code, SpringBoot, and Figma. I got hands on GitHub, MongoDB, and Ubuntu as well.
    Moreover, I progressed in soft skills like Time management, Problem solving, and Adaptability into the new environment.</p>

<p>Currently, I am seeking to maintain a position that offers professional challenges utlizing interpersonal skills, excellent time
  management and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I am persuing an online "Web Develpment Bootcamp 2023" course on Udemy, which
  focuses on jQuery, Bootstrap 5, Node, React, and DApps.
